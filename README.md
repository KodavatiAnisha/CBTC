Iris Flower Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using Python.

Files
Iris Flower - Iris.csv: Dataset containing sepal and petal measurements of Iris flowers.
Iris.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
deploy.py: Python script for deploying the trained model.
saved_model.sav: Saved machine learning model for deployment.
Dataset
Source: The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and was sourced from [mention the source or repository if applicable].
Analysis and Modeling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored relationships between features and visualized distributions.
Modeling: Trained several machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM. Achieved an accuracy of [mention accuracy score] on the test set.
